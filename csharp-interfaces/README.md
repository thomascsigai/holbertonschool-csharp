# C# Interfaces

## üìù Description
The "C# Interfaces" project explores the fundamental concepts of interfaces in C# programming, emphasizing their role in achieving abstraction, polymorphism, and decoupling in software development. Through this project, we implement various interfaces to model interactive behaviors, breakable objects, collectible items, and more, providing a comprehensive understanding of how interfaces can be used to design flexible and maintainable code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools Used
- **C#**: Utilized for its robust interface implementation capabilities.
- **.NET Core**: The framework for running C# applications.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Used for its powerful C# support and debugging tools.

## üìã Prerequisites
- .NET 5.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio Code with the C# extension or any preferred IDE with C# support

## üöÄ Installation and Configuration
Follow these steps to get the project up and running:
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the specific project directory
3. Build the project to verify everything is set up correctly

## üí° Usage
Utilize the implemented interfaces to manage object interactions within your C# applications, demonstrating the power of interface-based design.

## ‚ú® Main Features
1. **Interface Implementation**: Demonstrates how to define and implement interfaces.
2. **Abstraction Through Interfaces**: Showcases the use of interfaces to achieve abstraction.
3. **Polymorphism**: Utilizes interfaces to enable polymorphic behavior.
