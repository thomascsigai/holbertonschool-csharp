# C# - Delegates, Events

## 📝 Description
The "C# - Delegates, Events" project is an exploration into the use of delegates and events within the C# programming language. This project aims to demonstrate the power of delegates for encapsulating method references, the concept of multicasting, and the use of events to design loosely-coupled applications that respond to actions or occurrences. Through practical examples, learners will grasp how delegates and events contribute to asynchronous programming and the creation of reactive systems.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used
- **C#**: For implementing delegates, anonymous methods, events, and handling them.
- **.NET Core**: The framework providing the event model in C#.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Editor of choice for C# development.

## 📋 Prerequisites
- .NET 5.0 SDK or newer
- Visual Studio Code or any other compatible IDE with C# support

## 🚀 Installation and Configuration
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the `csharp-delegates_events` directory
3. Compile the code

## 💡 Usage
This project serves as a guide to understanding and applying delegates and events in your C# applications. Review the examples to learn about defining and subscribing to events, using delegates for method encapsulation, and the advantages of asynchronous programming.

## ✨ Main Features
1. **Universal Health**: Demonstrates the basic setup of a player's health system.
2. **Damage Delegation**: Introduces a delegate to handle damage calculation.
3. **Validation**: Incorporates methods to validate health points adjustments.
4. **Modified Behavior**: Explores the use of enums and delegates for modifying player actions.
5. **Check Yourself**: Implements event handling to monitor and react to the player's health status.
6. **Eventful**: Further explores event handling with customized event arguments.
